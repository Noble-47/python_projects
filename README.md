## Timetable

A simple python projects to explore the basis of [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) and [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
`timetable` serves as a command line utility for creating, viewing and resetting  
 a timetable csv file in a nice terminal table powered by [rich](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
 
 To view the current timetable simply run
 
  ```python3 timetable_cli.py showtable```

on the terminal in the directory that contains the files. 
*both click and rich are required*
